This project is an AI-powered image tagging system that automatically predicts relevant tags for an uploaded image.
Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras, the model learns to recognize visual patterns and classify images into predefined categories.

The project covers the full pipeline:

Data Preparation: Labeled dataset collection and preprocessing

Model Design: CNN architecture for feature extraction and classification

Training: Augmented data, optimized hyperparameters, and fine-tuning

Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, and recall to assess performance

Deployment: Streamlit app for real-time image tagging from a simple web interface

This system can be adapted for various domains such as e-commerce product tagging, content moderation, or photo organization.
It’s lightweight enough for educational purposes but designed with extendability in mind — you can plug in your own dataset or switch to a transfer learning backbone for better accuracy.
